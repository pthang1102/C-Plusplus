/*EXERCISE 1 (Basic input and output, arrays and pointers 1p)
Write a program that first asks from the user how many numbers he needs. After that the
program allocates memory space to store those numbers (integer array). Next the program
fills the array with random numbers between 0 - 992, and the program displays all
numbers from the array. After that the program calculates the mean of the generated
number calling a separate function, e.g. int mean(int *array, int n). Finally the
program frees the memory space it allocated.*/

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;
int mean(int* array, int n);

int main() {
	int* numbers;
	int average, random_num;
	srand(time(NULL));

	cout << "How many numbers :";
	int size = 0;
	cin >> size;

	numbers = new int[size];

	cout << "Random numbers generated are: \n";

	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		numbers[i] = rand () % 100;
		cout << numbers[i] << "\n";
	}

	average = mean(numbers, size);

	cout << "Mean is: " << average << "\n";
	delete[] numbers;
	return 0;
}

int mean(int* array, int n) {
	int sum = 0;
	int average;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		sum += array[i];
	}

	average = sum / n;
	return average;
}
