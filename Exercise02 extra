/* EXTRA EXERCISE (Counter, Dice and Inspector, 0,25p)
We used counter, dice and inspector objects in our example program that demonstrated object oriented thinking. 
The program generates 100 random numbers between (0.0, 1.0]. 
It counts how many of those numbers are between (0.0, 0.5] and how many between (0.5, 1].*/
